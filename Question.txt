Write a class in your preferred object-orientated language that represents a bank account.
During instantiating of the object it should receive the details of the person owning the account (e.g. name, dob, etc.) and the account itself (name of the bank, account no, etc. )
Don't worry about persisting data on storage, just keep all data in memory in the class!
Provide a method in the class to deposit money on the account.
Provide a method in the class to deduct money from the account.
Provide a method to return the current balance.
Provide a method to return the bank statement.
Provide a method to transfer money between accounts.


Use your class to create two objects that represent two accounts (Sujal & Rashi) and demonstrate these transaction steps:
deposit money on the account of Sujal
transfer part of the money from the account of Sujal to the account of Rashi
withdraw part of the received money from the account of Rashi
print bank statement of Sujal's account
print current balance of Rashi's account
